			<p>My name is Matthew Bender, and I am a sophomore Computer Engineering student at the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>
			<p>This past summer I had an internship at <a href="https://www.viasat.com">ViaSat</a> where I wrote a combination of frontend and backend code for clients to use. There I also participated in the ViaSat hackathon, where myself along with 2 other interns teamed up to code for 24 straight hours. At the end, we ended up winning country-wide for our company, with a web-based mapping system of ViaSat's offices that offered searching by office or room number, as well as showing the quickest route from one office to the next.</p>
			<p>At Maryland so far, I have taken classes on Data Stauctures, Computer Systems, Programming Languages, Algorithms, Digital Logic Design, Digital Circuits, Calculus, and Discrete Mathematics. I also took place in the <a href="https://www.windward.net/code-war/">Windward Code Wars</a> my freshman year, on a team with 4 other freshman. The goal was to design an A.I. that would compete with rival teams' A.I.'s to travel a course and reach goals that were constantly changing. Our team, "String theory;" placed 1st at the University of Maryland and went on to win 2nd place in the worldwide competition.</p>
